              <p>
                I studied in Beijing and had planned to work there for more job opportunities, higher salaries and a dynamic lifestyle. However, due to the high living costs, fierce competition for jobs and stricter settlement regulations, I had to reconsider and think about going back to my hometown in Hefei where more and more multinational companies have started establishing themselves, providing more opportunities for graduates such as me. The environment had developed for better all-round living too. This means that my life in Hefei at Corning, I have everything I need and prospects to keep moving up the career ladder. Plus, more importantly, as a single child being brought up by my parents, it is now my time to take care of them. As I continue on my career path, I am slowly planning for my future. I would like to buy property and a car for a better quality of life. These two are almost unaffordable in cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen or Guangzhou.
