      <p>A city built for the modern life provides us with pleasure and comfort in living, but it is history that gives richness to Hefei. When you walk along the Huaihe Road and visit the legendary former residence of Li Hongzhang, you will go back in time and see the late Qing dynasty with your own eyes.</p>
      <p><strong>Late Qing Dynasty Li Hongzhang’s residence</strong></p>
      <p>Walk along Huaihe Road and you’ll know you’re at Li Hongzhang’s residence when you stand in front of a majestic building in the style of Ming, Qing and Hui dynasties. Whether you are in the front hall admiring the lifework of Li Hongzhang; taking in the beauty of the wooden sculpture in the middle hall, strolling through the elegantly tiled study room, or exploring the mysterious Zouma Building, this residence is sure to take you back in time to relive the dynamics of the late Qing dynasty.</p>
      <p><strong>Birthplace of Talent</strong></p>
      <p>As the old saying goes, “a place derives reflected glory from an illustrious son”. That must be the reason why Hefei is a place filled with many talents throughout its history. Li Hongzhang, who controlled the political situation in the late Qing Dynasty, was born in Hefei. Other talents born here include Bao Zheng – the symbol of justice, Zhou Yu of the Three Kingdoms, Fan Zeng of the Chu-Han Contention, General Sun Liren of the anti-Japanese period and Nobel Prize winner Mr. Yang Zhenning.</p>
